### Introduction

The  evolvement  computational  biology  is  used  in healthcare  industry.  It  allows  collection  of  stored patient data for the prediction of the disease. There are prediction  algorithms  which  are  available  for  the diagnosis of the disease at early stages. The medical information systems are rich of datasets but there are only few intelligent systems which can easily analysis the  disease.  Over  a  period  of  time,  the  machine learning algorithms have started playing a crucial role in resolving the complex and non-linear problems in the  developing  model.  In  any  disease  prediction models are used to override the features that can be selected from different datasets which can be used in classification in healthy patient as accurate as possible. If  this  is not  done,  misclassification  can  lead  to  a healthy patient getting unnecessary treatment.  The Thyroid gland is an endocrine gland present in the human neck beneath the Adam’s apple which help in secretion of thyroid hormone that influence the rate of metabolism  and  protein  synthesis.  The  thyroid hormones are useful in counting how briskly the heart beats  and  how  fast  we  burn  calories.  The  thyroid secretes  two  types  of  active  hormones  called levothyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones  help in  regulating  the  body  temperature. These also aid in energy-bearing and transmission in every  part  of  the  body  and  decisive  in  protein management.  Iodine  is  considered  as  the  main building block of the thyroid gland. It’s prostrated in few  specific  problems.  Undersupply  of  these hormones  can  lead  to  hyperthyroidism.  There  are many originations  related  to  hyperthyroidism  and underactive  thyroids.  There  are  various  kinds  of medications like thyroid surgery is liable to ionizing radiation,  continual  tenderness  of  the  thyroid, deficiency  of  iodine  and  lack  of  enzyme  to  make thyroid hormones.
